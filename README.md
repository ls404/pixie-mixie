# PIXIE MIXIE - crazy pixel art maker



## General

This project is the final of my **Udacity Google code challenge - frontend** training.

Since this is my first frontend project, if you expect concise and well structured code, please look somewhere else. (You can always ask Linus Torvalds which code is written well.)

## F.A.Q

- Why **"pixie mixie"**?

  It resembles original task name - "Pixel art maker" and I needed 5 symbols for color and 5 for background color palettes. Actually app name is used as color selector.

- What is **target audience/users**?

  Between 3 and 6 y.o. Since you are reading that, you most probably are not part of intended audience, but hope that grown ups will enjoy it too. This is the reason for not having textual explanations in interface.

- What is the app goal?

  This app allows simple pixel art, but have some small but nifty additional capabilities, which allows with few clicks to achieve crazy stunning  visuals.

- Why is interface so weird?

  This is not graphical editor, but CSS effects fixer. This unexpected capabilities allows interesting side effects.
