[pixie-mixie link](https://vladimirov1.github.io/pixie-mixie/)

## General

This project is the final of my **Udacity Google code challenge - frontend** training.

Since this is my first frontend project, if you expect concise and well structured code, please look somewhere else. Code quality however will be increased gradually.

## F.A.Q

- Why **"pixie mixie"**?

  It resembles original task name - "Pixel art maker" and I needed 5 symbols for color and 5 for background color palettes. Actually app name is used as color selector.

- What is **target audience/users**?

  Between 3 and 6 y.o. Since you are reading that, you most probably are not part of intended audience, but hope that grown ups will enjoy it too. This is the reason for not having textual explanations in interface.

- What is the app goal?

  This app allows simple pixel art, but have some small but nifty additional capabilities, which allows with few clicks to achieve crazy stunning  visuals.

- Why is interface so weird?

  This is not graphical editor, but CSS effects fixer. This unexpected capabilities allows interesting side effects. 

  ## How to use?

  ## TODO

  - [ ] New interface - old one limiting quick selection to palettes only (in order to limit colourfulness) is not intuitive
  - [ ] Move to Bulma.
  - [ ] Help system - contextual
  - [ ] Recreate interface if necessary
  - [ ] Finish planned functionality
  - [ ] Awesome cursors to be added as helper.
